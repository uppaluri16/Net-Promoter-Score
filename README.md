# Net-Promoter-Score

You've been asked to analyze user survey data and report NPS to the management.

But, what exactly is NPS?
Have you all seen that every month, you get a survey form from Satisfaction survey from customers?
This form asks you to fill in feedback regarding how you are liking the services of company in terms of a numerical score.
This is known as the Likelihood to Recommend Survey.
It is widely used by different companies and service providers to evaluate their performance and customer satisfaction.

Responses are given a scale ranging from 0–10, with 0 labeled with “Not at all likely,” and 10 labeled with “Extremely likely.”
Based on this, we calculate the Net Promoter Score.

We label our responses into 3 categories:
Detractors: Respondents with a score of 0-6
Passive: Respondents with a score of 7-8
Promoters: Respondents with a score of 9-10.

How to calculate NPS score?
Net Promoter score = % Promoters - % Detractors.

Range of NPS
If all people are promoters (rated 9-10), we get NPS 100
Conversely, if all people are detractors (rated 0-6), we get NPS -100
Also, if all people are neutral (rated 7-8), we get a NPS 0
Therefore, the range of NPS lies between [-100, 100]
Generally, each company targets to get at least a threshold NPS.
For Scaler, this is a score of 70.
This means that if NPS >70, it is great performance of the company.
Naturally, this varies from business to business.

Why would we want to analyse the survey data for NPS? How is NPS helpful?
NPS helps a brand in gauging its brand value and sentiment in the market.
Promoters are highly likely to recommend your product or sevice. Hence, bringing in more business.
whereas, Detractors are likely to recommend against your product or service’s usage. Hence, bringing the business down.
These insights can help business make customer oriented decision along with product improvisation.

Two third of Fortune 500 companies use NPS.
Every month, companies randomnly reach out to our customers over a call, and try to understand,
How is the overall experience for them? What are some things that they like? What do they don't like?
Based on the feedback received, sometimes we end up getting really good insights, and tackle them.
This will help improve the next month's NPS
